<p>I&#39;ve been a React developer since its inception. When I first encountered it, there was an air of mystery surrounding it as it distinguished itself from its competitors by emphasizing the exclusive use of components. Over a decade later, I find myself unable to envision working with any other framework in the near future. React continues to reinvent itself while pushing other frameworks around it to evolve too. As a freelance web developer collaborating closely with companies, React is my indispensable daily companion, enhancing my productivity in every project.</p>
<p>&quot;The Road to React&quot; made its debut in 2016, and since then, I&#39;ve almost rewritten it annually. This book teaches the core principles of React, guiding you through building a practical application in pure React without complex tooling. The book covers everything from setting up the project to deploying it on a server. Each chapter includes additional recommended reading and exercises. By the end, you&#39;ll have the skills to develop your own React applications.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Road to React,&quot; I establish a solid foundation before delving into the broader React ecosystem. The book clarifies general concepts, patterns, and best practices for real-world React applications. Ultimately, you&#39;ll learn to construct a React application from scratch, incorporating features such as pagination, client-side and server-side searching, and advanced UI interactions like sorting. My aspiration is that this book conveys my passion for React and JavaScript, helping you embark on your journey with confidence.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h2>
<p>I am a German software and web developer with a passion for learning and teaching JavaScript. Following the completion of my Master&#39;s Degree in computer science, I immersed myself in the startup world, extensively using JavaScript both professionally and in my free time. Collaborating with an exceptional team of engineers in Berlin, we developed large-scale JavaScript applications which sparked my interest in sharing this knowledge with others.</p>
<p>During this time, I regularly authored articles on web development for my website. Positive feedback from readers seeking to learn from my articles motivated me to refine my writing and teaching style. With each article, my ability to effectively educate others continued to grow. Witnessing students thrive by providing them with clear objectives and quick feedback loops is particularly fulfilling.</p>
<p>Presently, I operate as a self-employed web developer, closely working with companies on their products. More information about collaborating with me can be found on my <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/">website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

By having an account on my platform, you&#39;ll always enjoy access to the most up-to-date version of the book. Thank you for your support!</p>
<p><strong>Why is the print version so large?</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;ve acquired the print version of the book, consider making notes directly in its pages. The deliberate choice to keep the printed book extra-large was made to provide ample space for extensive code snippets and to afford you sufficient room for your annotations and personal notes. This size decision was crafted with the intention of enhancing your overall reading and learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the book not have many pages?</strong></p>
<p>The print version&#39;s larger dimensions contribute to fewer pages. While most sections are concise, detailed material is available online for in-depth insights. This allows a smooth reading experience, with essential React concepts covered in the book for a quick start. Engaging in optional exercises is encouraged for a comprehensive understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the book written like a long read tutorial?</strong></p>
<p>The unconventional manner in which this book is written and structured might come as a surprise to those more accustomed to the conventional format of programming texts. When I first started coding, there was a scarcity of practical, hands-on resources available. As a learner, I found great value in materials that provided step-by-step instructions, guiding me through not only the &#39;what&#39; and &#39;how&#39; but also the &#39;why&#39; behind each concept. With the goal of replicating this immersive learning experience, I&#39;ve taken on the task of self-publishing, hoping to extend this valuable knowledge-sharing opportunity to fellow developers within our community.</p>
<p><strong>What do I do if I encounter a bug?</strong></p>
<p>Should you come across any bugs in the code, locate the current GitHub project URL at the end of each section. Feel free to open a GitHub issue there, and your assistance will be highly valued!</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-for-">Who is this book for?</h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript Beginners</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript beginners with knowledge in fundamental JS, CSS, and HTML: If you just started out with web development, and have a basic grasp of JS, CSS, and HTML, this book should give you everything that&#39;s needed to learn React. However, if you feel there is a gap in your JavaScript knowledge, don&#39;t hesitate to read up on that topic before continuing with the book. You will have lots of references to fundamental JavaScript knowledge in this book though.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript Veterans</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript veterans coming from jQuery: If you have used JavaScript with jQuery, MooTools, and Dojo extensively back in the days, the new JavaScript era may seem overwhelming for someone getting back on track with it. However, most of the fundamental knowledge didn&#39;t change, it&#39;s still JavaScript and HTML under the hood, so this book should give you the right start into React.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript Enthusiasts</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript enthusiasts with knowledge in other modern SPA frameworks: If you are coming from Angular or Vue, there may be lots of differences in how to write applications with React, however, all these frameworks share the same fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML. After a mindset shift to get comfortable with React, you should be doing just fine adopting React.</p>
<p><strong>Non-JavaScript Developers</strong></p>
<p>If you are coming from another programming language, you should be more familiar than others with the different aspects of programming. After picking up the fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML, you should have a good time learning React with me.</p>
<p><strong>Designers and UI/UX Enthusiasts</strong></p>
<p>If your main profession is in design, user interaction, or user experience, don&#39;t hesitate to pick up this book. You may be already quite familiar with HTML and CSS which is a plus. After going through some more JavaScript fundamentals, you should be good to get through this book. These days UI/UX is moving closer to the implementation details which are often taken care of with React. It would be your perfect asset to know how things work in code.</p>
<p><strong>Team Leads, Product Owners, or Product Managers</strong></p>
<p>If you are a team lead, product owner or product manager of your development department, this book should give you a good breakdown of all the essential parts of a React application. Every section explains one React concept/pattern/technique to add another feature or to improve the overall architecture. It&#39;s a well-rounded reference guide for React.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-the-book-">How to read the book?</h2>
<p>Most programming books are high-level and go into very much technical detail, but they lack the ability to get their readers into coding. That&#39;s why this book may be different from the books that you are used to reading in this domain, because it attempts to teach aspiring developers actual programming. Hence I try to keep a good balance between being pragmatic, by giving you all the tools to get the job done, while still being detail-oriented, by giving you as much information as needed to understand these tools and how they are used in practice.</p>
<p>Every section in this book introduces you to a new topic. For the fast pace learners who do not want to go into much detail, it&#39;s possible to read from section to section. However, if learners want to dive deeper into certain topics, they can read more by following the footnotes. I want to offer you a way to get a great overview of the topic at hand while still enabling you to dig deeper if you want to. After reading the book either way, you should be able to code what you have learned in a pragmatic way.</p>
<p><strong>Take Notes</strong></p>
<p>If you have a print version of the book, do not hesitate to underline paragraphs, to write notes, or to annotate code snippets. That&#39;s why it has such a large size in the first place. If you don&#39;t have a print version, keep a notebook on the side for your learnings. Taking notes fortifies what you have learned and you can always come back to them. With every new learning, you will get a better understanding of the big picture and how the smaller pieces fit together, so it&#39;s a great exercise on the side to write down your learnings on a piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>Code Code Code</strong></p>
<p>Every section introduces you to a new topic in a pragmatic way. For this reason just reading through the section does not suffice to become a developer, because there is lots of things going on in one section alone. So you shouldn&#39;t rush from section to section, but instead I recommend you to have a computer by your side which allows you to code along the way.</p>
<p>Do not just copy paste code, instead type it yourself. Do not be satisfied when you just used the code from the book, instead experiment with it. See what breaks the code and how to fix it. See how certain changes affect the result. And see how you can extend or even improve the code by adding a few lines to it. That&#39;s what coding is all about after all. It does not help you to rush through the book if you haven&#39;t written a line of code once. So get your hands dirty and do more coding than reading!</p>
<p><strong>Anticipate</strong></p>
<p>There will be many coding problems presented in this book. Often I will give you the option to solve things yourself before reading about the solution in the next paragraph or code snippet. However, it breaks the flow of repeating myself, so I keep these encouragements to a minimum. Instead I am hoping for your eagerness here to jump ahead. Try to solve things before I get the chance to present you the solution. Only by trying, failing, and solving a problem you will become a better developer.</p>
<p><strong>Take Breaks</strong></p>
<p>Since every section introduces you to a new topic, it happens fast that you forget the learnings from the previous section. In addition to coding along with every section, I recommend you to take breaks between the sections which allow the learnings to sink in. Read the section, code along the way, do the exercise afterwards, code even a bit more if you like, and then rest. Think about your learnings while taking a walk outside or speak with someone about what you have learned even though this other person is not into coding. After all, taking breaks is always essential if you want to learn something new.</p>
